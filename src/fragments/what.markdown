What is Tilling?
--------------------

**Tiling** provides a *simple window tiling* system for
linux. This is for those who cannot (or don't want to) use a tiling window
manager like awesome or Xmonad.

There is no menu nor GUI in **tiling**. This is because I want 
to keep **tiling** as simple as possible. You just (optionaly)
focus a window and press a keyboard shortcut and that's it: all windows in 
the current virtual desktop are tiled.

For now **tiling** provides two layouts: horizontal and vertical,
where a «master» window occupy the top, or the left, of the screen, while
remaining windows share the rest of the screen.
